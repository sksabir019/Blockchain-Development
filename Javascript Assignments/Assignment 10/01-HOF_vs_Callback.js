/**
 * Higher order functions and callback functions are similar, but not the same. 
 * 
 * Higher order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments, allowing you to manipulate and process data more easily. For example, in JavaScript, you can use a higher order function such as map() to iterate over a collection of items, performing an operation on each item. 
 * 
 * Callback functions are functions that are passed as an argument to another function. These are often used in asynchronous code, allowing code to execute after a certain event has occurred. For example, in JavaScript, you can pass a callback function to setTimeout(), to wait for a certain amount of time before executing the callback function.
