/**
 Yes, generator functions are iterable in JavaScript, which means they can be used with language features that expect an iterable object, such as the for-of loop or the spread operator (...).

 When you create a generator function, it does not execute immediately. Instead, it returns a special iterator object that can be used to control the execution of the generator. This iterator object is iterable, which means it can be used with language features that expect an iterable object.
 */
//Here is an example of using a generator function with the for-of loop in JavaScript:

function* generator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

// Create an iterator for the generator
const iterator = generator();

// Use the iterator with the for-of loop
for (const value of iterator) {
  console.log(value);
} // 1 2 3

//Here is an example of using a generator function with the spread operator in JavaScript:

function* generator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

// Create an iterator for the generator
const iterator1 = generator();

// Use the iterator with the spread operator
const array = [...iterator1];

console.log(array); // [1, 2, 3]

/**In this example, the spread operator expands the values yielded by the generator and collects them into an array. This allows you to use the values yielded by the generator in a context where you need an array, rather than an iterator.
 
 Note that you can also use the Array.from() method to convert the values yielded by a generator into an array. This is similar to using the spread operator, but it allows you to specify a mapping function that will be applied to each value yielded by the generator before it is added to the array.
 */

//Here is an example of using the Array.from() method with a generator function:

function* generator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

// Create an iterator for the generator
const iterator2 = generator();

// Use the Array.from() method to convert the generator's values into an array
const array1 = Array.from(iterator2, (value) => value * 2);

console.log(array); // [2, 4, 6]
/**
 * In this example, the Array.from() method maps each value yielded by the generator to a new value by multiplying it by 2, and then collects these values into an array. This allows you to perform transformations on the values yielded by the generator before they are added to the array.
