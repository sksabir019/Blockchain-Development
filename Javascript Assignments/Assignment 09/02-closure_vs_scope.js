/**
 * The main difference between a closure and a scope is that a closure captures variables from its enclosing scope. 
 * 
 * A scope, on the other hand, is an area in which variables, objects, and functions are accessible. 
 * 
 * A closure has access to the outer scope whereas a scope can define variables but cannot capture them from the outer scope.
