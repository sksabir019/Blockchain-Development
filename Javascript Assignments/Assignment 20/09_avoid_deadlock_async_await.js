/**
 * ne way to avoid deadlocks when using async/await is to always use await within a try/catch block. This will allow any errors that occur while using await to be caught and handled, preventing the code from getting stuck in an endless waiting state. Additionally, it is good practice to ensure that any function that uses await is marked with the async keyword, so that it returns a Promise that can be handled properly.

//Here is an example of how to use await within a try/catch block:
async function someAsyncOperation() {
  try {
    // Perform some async operation that returns a Promise
    let result = await somePromise();
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors that occur while using await
    console.log(error);
  }
