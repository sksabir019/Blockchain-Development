/**
 * Async/await has been used in a variety of real-world applications to improve the performance and scalability of asynchronous code. Here are three examples of how async/await has been used in real-world applications:

Server-side web development: Async/await is often used in server-side web development to improve the performance and scalability of web applications. For example, the Express.js web framework, which is widely used to build server-side web applications in Node.js, supports async/await for writing middleware functions and route handlers. This allows developers to use async/await to write efficient, scalable code that can handle a high volume of concurrent requests.

Database operations: Async/await is often used in applications that perform database operations to improve the performance and scalability of these operations. For example, the MongoDB Node.js driver supports async/await for executing database queries and operations. This allows developers to use async/await to write efficient, scalable code that can handle a large number of concurrent database operations.

Network operations: Async/await is also commonly used in applications that perform network operations, such as making HTTP requests or streaming data over a network. For example, the Axios library, which is widely used to make HTTP requests in Node.js, supports async/await for writing code that performs HTTP requests. This allows developers to use async/await to write efficient, scalable code that can handle a high volume of concurrent network operations.
