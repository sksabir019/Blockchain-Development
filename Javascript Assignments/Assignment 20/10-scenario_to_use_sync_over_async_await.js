/**
 * Synchronous code should generally be used in situations where the code needs to be executed in a specific order and cannot continue until the previous operation has completed. For example, if you have a series of operations that depend on the results of previous operations, it would be best to use synchronous code to ensure that the operations are executed in the correct order.
 */
//Here is an example of when synchronous code might be appropriate:
// This function performs some synchronous operations
function doSynchronousOperations() {
  // Perform operation 1
  let result1 = someSynchronousOperation1();

  // Perform operation 2, using the result of operation 1
  let result2 = someSynchronousOperation2(result1);

  // Perform operation 3, using the result of operation 2
  let result3 = someSynchronousOperation3(result2);

  // Return the final result
  return result3;
}

/**
 * In this example, the doSynchronousOperations function performs three synchronous operations in a specific order, using the results of previous operations in subsequent operations. This type of code is best implemented using synchronous code, because the order in which the operations are performed is important and cannot be changed.

On the other hand, asynchronous code is best used in situations where the order in which the operations are performed is not important, and the code can continue executing while the asynchronous operations are being performed. For example, if you have a series of independent operations that do not depend on the results of previous operations, it would be best to use asynchronous code to allow the operations to be performed concurrently.

// This function performs some asynchronous operations
