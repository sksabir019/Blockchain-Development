/**
 * Async/await is a language feature in JavaScript that allows you to write asynchronous code using a more synchronous, sequential style. This makes asynchronous code easier to read and understand, which can improve performance and scalability by making it easier to write and maintain efficient, scalable code.

One of the main benefits of using async/await is that it allows you to write asynchronous code using a syntax that looks and behaves like synchronous code. This means you can use familiar control flow constructs, such as if statements and for loops, to write asynchronous code without having to use callback functions or promises.
 */

//For example, here is some asynchronous code that uses a callback function to read a file and print its contents to the console:
fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8", (error, data) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return;
  }

  console.log(data);
});
/**
 * This code uses the fs.readFile() method to asynchronously read a file and pass the contents to a callback function. The callback function checks for an error, and if one is present, it logs the error to the console and returns. Otherwise, it logs the contents of the file to the console.

This code works, but it is not very easy to read and understand. The callback function is nested inside the fs.readFile() method, which makes the code hard to follow and can make it difficult to add additional logic or error handling.
 */

// Here is the same code written using async/await:

async function readFile() {
  try {
    const data = await fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8");
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

readFile();

/**
 * In this example, the readFile() function is marked as async, which allows you to use the await keyword inside the function. The await keyword is used to wait for the fs.readFile() method to asynchronously read the file and return the contents.

This code is much easier to read and understand than the callback-based version. It uses a try/catch block to handle errors, which allows you to write the error-handling logic in a clear, concise way. It also uses familiar control flow constructs, such as if statements and for loops, which makes the code easier to read and understand.

By making asynchronous code easier to read and understand, async/await can improve performance and scalability by making it easier to write and maintain efficient, scalable code. This can help you avoid common pitfalls, such as callback hell and race conditions, which can reduce the performance and scalability of your code.
