  /**
   * This code adds an event listener to the "beforeunload" event of the window object. The "beforeunload" event is triggered when the user tries to leave the page, either by closing the browser window or navigating to a different page. The event listener shows an alert to the user and then cancels the default behavior of the "beforeunload" event, effectively preventing the user from leaving the page.

Note that this code is just an example, and it is generally not considered good practice to use alerts to prevent users from leaving a page. In most cases, it is better to provide users with clear and useful information about why they should stay on the page, rather than trying to force them to stay. Additionally, some browsers may block or ignore the alerts shown by this code, making it less effective.
